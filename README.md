# R-projects

This repository demonstrates proficiency in R programming foundations like data types, subsetting, control flow, functions, and more through projects including chatbots, games, web scraping, and other applications. It also contains R code and analysis from data projects focused on extracting insights using R programming. It showcases proficiency in data wrangling, visualization, modeling, and reporting with R and RStudio. Projects exhibit core skills like importing/exporting data, tidy data principles, R Markdown, and R packages for EDA, regression, classification, clustering, and more. The repository presents my ability to leverage R for end-to-end data analysis and statistics.

Some projects are based on or inspired by analysis and code from online learning sources and tutorials which provided helpful instruction. However, recreating similar projects was done solely for learning purposes and does not imply the work is copied. Beyond any referenced sources, the code, visualizations, and findings represent my own work demonstrating proficiency in R.
